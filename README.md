🏦 Banking Management System Project :

Welcome to the Banking Management System project! This Java-based application allows you to manage user accounts, perform transactions, and ensure the security of financial data.
Project Description: Banking Management System

The Banking Management System is a Java-based application designed to efficiently manage banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) for database integration. This system provides a secure and user-friendly interface for customers and bank staff to perform essential banking tasks such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, balance inquiries, and transaction history tracking.

Key Features :

✅ User Authentication – Secure login system for customers and administrators.

✅ Account Management – Create, update, and manage bank accounts.

✅ Transactions Handling – Perform deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers.

✅ Database Connectivity – Uses JDBC to interact with a relational database for data storage and retrieval.

✅ OOP Implementation – Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism ensure modularity and scalability.

✅ Error Handling & Security – Proper exception handling and security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

This project is ideal for understanding core Java concepts, database integration, and real-world banking applications while emphasizing modular, scalable, and efficient coding practices.
